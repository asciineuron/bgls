    "Relative to the usual qubit by qubit sampling algorithm, you should use `BGLS` when its easier to compute probabilities than it is to compute marginal distributions. This is generally true for memory-limited cases when you cannot store the entire statevector in classical memory, for example with [Clifford states](./clifford_simulation.ipynb) and [matrix product states](./mps_simulation.ipynb). Read below to see a summary of [Bravyi, Gosset, and Liu's argument](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.084990) for why this is true."

    "How many probabilities do you need to compute during state evolution for `BGLS`? For an operation $U_t$, you need to compute $2^{\\text{supp}(U_t)}$ probabilities where $\\text{supp}(U_t)$ (the support of $U_t$) is the number of qubits that $U_t$ acts on. So for a depth $d$ circuit $U := U_d \\cdots U_1$ you need to compute $\\sum_{t = 1}^{d} 2^{\\text{supp}(U_t)}$ probabilities. This quantity is upper bounded by $d 2^k$ where $k = \\max_t \\text{supp}(U_t)$. Letting $f(n, d)$ denote the cost of computing an amplitude (probability) from a depth $d$, $n$-qubit circuit, the cost of `BGLS` gate-by-gate sampling is thus at most $d 2^k f(n, d)$. "
